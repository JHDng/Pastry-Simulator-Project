## About the project
- The project was conceived in order to apply concepts acquired during the "ALGORITHMS AND PRINCIPLES OF COMPUTER SCIENCE" course
- The aim is to create a simplified simulation of a pastry with orders coming in, orders to deliver out and resources(ingredients) to manage
- An important factor is efficiency, so the project challenged my data structure and optimization knowledge to minimize the space and time required
